We're super excited to release v0.1.1 of the `era-snap`, which includes an important fix for that pesky attendance recording issue some of you were experiencing.\r\n\r\n### Attendance Recording Issue Resolved - No More Missed Clock-Ins! 👏\r\n\r\nIn the initial alpha release of v0.1.0, we heard from a few of you that the attendance recording functionality wasn't always tracking students clock-ins and clock-outs correctly. That's not good - we want to make sure all your attendance data is 100% accurate!\r\n\r\nWell, good news - this patch release addresses that problem, and we've thoroughly tested the attendance recording to make sure it's working reliably. No more missed clock-ins or wonky attendance data, I promise! 😊\r\n\r\n## Keep the Feedback Coming! 🙏\r\n\r\nAs this is still an alpha release, we'd love to hear what you think! If you run into any other issues or have suggestions, please [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/shahil-yadav/erp-snap/issues) or reach out to our support team.\r\n\r\nWe're committed to continually improving the `erp-snap` and delivering an awesome, reliable experience. Thanks for being part of our alpha testing journey - your feedback is super valuable! 💪\r\n\r\nHappy Tracking, friends! 🎉"
